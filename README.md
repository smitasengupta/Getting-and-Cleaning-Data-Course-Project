The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:
•	Download the dataset 
•	Load the activity and feature information
•	Loads both the training and test datasets
•	Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset
•	Merges the two datasets
•	Converts the activity and subject columns into factors
•	Creates a tidy dataset 
The end result is shown in the file tidy.txt.
